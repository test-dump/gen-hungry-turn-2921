Create a new project in your IDE (Visual Studio, for example). Select `Console App (.NET Core)` or `Console App (.NET Framework)` template, according to your needs.\n\n2. You should now have a Program.cs file open, with some basic code already inserted. The main function is the function that will be called when your application is launched.\n\nHere is a minimal `Hello, World!` program in C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can replace the existing code in the `Main` function with the line `Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");`. This line of code will print the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\n\n3. Run your console application either by clicking the `Start Debugging` button in your IDE or by using the Command-Line Interface to navigate to the directory containing your project and then executing the `dotnet run` command.\n\nThe console should then display \"Hello, World!\"."}]
