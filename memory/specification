You can create a simple console application in C# to display "Hello, World!" with the following steps:

1. Create a new project in your IDE (Visual Studio, for example). Select `Console App (.NET Core)` or `Console App (.NET Framework)` template, according to your needs.

2. You should now have a Program.cs file open, with some basic code already inserted. The main function is the function that will be called when your application is launched.

Here is a minimal `Hello, World!` program in C#:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

You can replace the existing code in the `Main` function with the line `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");`. This line of code will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

3. Run your console application either by clicking the `Start Debugging` button in your IDE or by using the Command-Line Interface to navigate to the directory containing your project and then executing the `dotnet run` command.

The console should then display "Hello, World!".
