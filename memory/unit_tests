Important things to remember:
- The `Console.WriteLine` method is used to print text to the console.
- The `Main` method is the entry point of a C# console application. When the application starts, the `Main` method is the first method that gets invoked.
- You can use string interpolation to include variable values within a string. For example, `"Hello, {name}!"` where `name` is a variable. This would replace `{name}` with the value of the `name` variable.
- Comments in C# are created using `//` for a single line, or `/* */` for multiple lines.
- Proper indentation and formatting make your code easier to read and understand. Many IDEs have auto-formatting capabilities.
- Always make sure to save your work before running your application. Some IDEs will auto-save your work when you attempt to run your application, but others may not.
- Errors in your code will prevent your application from running. If you get an error, read the error message carefully to understand what's wrong and what you need to fix. You can also search for the error message online to get hints on how to fix it.
